# BXBot - A simple discord bot that generates scorecards for various rhythm games

## Usage
Once the bot is in your discord server, first register using `/register`, then link your Kamaitachi profile using `/kamai {kamai_username}`.

The main use for the bot is to generate a scorecard for the game of your choosing (supported by Kamaitachi). Cover arts are stored locally, and are fetched to the database when they're requested.

## Current scope

For now, the bot fully supports MaimaiDX (Prism+), Chunithm (Verse), Sound Voltex.

Jubeat, IIDX, WACCA & Ongeki support to come.

*note that games with a "recent" score system will probably not have an accurate in-game representation. Recents are dumb anyways.

## Thanks
Thanks to Kamaitachi for providing the API, as well as Zetaraku for providing cover arts for many games.
